How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was very quick

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It reduces the amount of thinking that would have been done manually.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It allows one to review and resolve issues with new version easily

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Each commit contains a logical change

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will be used to view all file commits to a repository
    git diff will be used to compare differences between two file commits in a repository

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very confident because git checkout lets you checkout a previous version and together
    with git log and git diff you can figure out the version that introduced the error

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Every projects I can think of
